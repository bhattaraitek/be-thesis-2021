This repository contains R- programming scripts used in undergraduate research related to hydroclimatic characterization and climate change for exploratory data analysis, future climate projection using CMIP6 outputs and presentation of results using spatial maps.

This was my first time using R for data analysis, so reusablity and efficiency of scripts could be limited.
